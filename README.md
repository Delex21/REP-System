# REP-System
REP System FiveM

Greetings comrades,

I found this one on my old harddrive and I am currently throwing away stuff.

I present you: My idiotic, unoptimalized, Dutchgarbage REP system.

I want to share this piece of (s)crap because I am not continuing with it, but yet it works tho (don’t ask me how) Honestly I feel a little bit ashamed, but thinking about open source I just release it anyways.

# It requires:

ESX/Essentialmode
PNotify
MySQL

# How to use?

Import the SQL file
start the resource
Use /rep to give someone a REP point. If you enter a negative value it will reduce the REP points from the player.
I had ideas to extend this stuff but I won’t. So good luck, use it as a snapshot or whatever…

Delex
